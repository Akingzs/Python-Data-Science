Deep Learning:
- Subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
- Focuses on the development of algorithms and models that mimic the human brain's information processing and learning from data.
- Models are called artificial neural networks, consisting of several layers of interconnected mathematical neurons.
- Processes information in a hierarchical and non-linear way.

"Deep" in Deep Learning:
- Refers to the presence of several hidden layers in a neural network.
- Allows the model to learn more complex and abstract representations of the data.
- Contrasts with shallow learning, which involves models with only one or a few hidden layers.

Applications of Deep Learning:
- Computer Vision: Object recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, facial recognition, and image synthesis.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Automatic translation, sentiment analysis, text generation, automatic summarization, and speech recognition.
- Recommendation Systems: Collaborative filtering, content personalization, and user segmentation.
- Games: Training agents to play video games or board games like Go and chess.
- Robotics: Autonomous navigation, manipulator control, and human-robot interaction.
- Time Series Analysis: Demand forecasting, trend analysis, and anomaly detection.

Success Factors of Deep Learning:
- Increased availability of data.
- Advances in computing power (especially GPUs).
- Improvements in training techniques and model architectures.
