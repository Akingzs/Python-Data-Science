* Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained with a labeled data set, where input examples are associated with correct outputs. The goal is to learn to map inputs to outputs and make accurate predictions on new and unknown data. 

* Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained with an unlabeled data set and the goal is to identify patterns, structures, or clusters in the data. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction. 

* Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns to make decisions based on interactions with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The goal is to maximize the reward accumulated over time.

Machine Learning has many practical applications in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, recommendation systems and medical diagnosis, among others.

SUPERVISED learning is one of the main types of Machine Learning approaches that we will see in practice now in this chapter. 

In this method, the algorithm is trained using a set of labeled data, where each input example has a corresponding output, also known as a "label" or "tag". The goal is for the model to learn to map the inputs to the correct outputs and thus be able to make accurate predictions for new and unknown data. 

During the training process, the algorithm analyzes the input examples and adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between the generated predictions and the correct outputs (labels). This process is carried out iteratively until the model reaches an acceptable level of accuracy. 

Supervised learning can be applied to two main types of problems:

* Regression: when the expected output is a continuous value, such as predicting property prices or estimating of a person's age based on specific characteristics. 

* Classification: when the expected output is a category or class, such as determining whether an email is spam or not spam, or identifying the species of a plant based on measurements of its characteristics .

Supervised learning is widely used in many practical applications, such as handwritten digit recognition, medical diagnosis and sentiment analysis in texts, among others.

1. Classification:
Classification is a type of supervised learning where the output is a categorical variable. It involves predicting the class or category of a given input data. For example, an algorithm can learn to predict whether a given email is spam or not.

    Types of Classification:
    - Binary Classification: Classifying the input into one of two classes. For example, determining whether a person has a certain disease or not.
    - Multiclass Classification: Classifying the input into one of several classes. For example, determining which species a flower belongs to based on data about different species.

2. Regression:
Regression is another type of supervised learning where the output is a continuous variable. It involves predicting a numerical output based on the value of one or more predictor variables. For example, a regression algorithm could be used to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features.

3. Clustering:
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where the goal is to group similar data points together. It's used when you have unlabeled data and you want to find some inherent grouping among them. For example, you can group documents by topic or stars by brightness.

    Types of Clustering:
    - Hard Clustering: Each data point belongs to a cluster completely or not.
    - Soft Clustering: Instead of assigning each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that point being in that cluster is evaluated.
